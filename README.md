# meme-generator

### Project Description

A Meme generator built to learn the fundamentals of React State and UseEffect and how to work with APIs on React apps.
The app renders the component and runs UseEffect to fetch an Array of Memes from Imgflip API and saves it into local state.
Two input text boxes are used to write top and bottom lines to state of a {meme} object and a button fetches a random img from the saved array of memes in state and uses it to update the Meme Object in state.
